This repository contains Numpy For Data Science course tutorials from the Udemy website. https://www.udemy.com/course/python-numpy-exercises

In this course, the first step will be taken in learning the Python Numpy library. The content of this course includes the following:

 - Python Numpy Library from Scratch
 - Numpy Arrays - 1D, 2D, 3D, Zeros, Ones, Full Arrays etc
 - Numpy Functions - Random, Linspace, Empty, Eye, Identity, Transpose, Diagonal Function etc
 - Indexing in Numpy Arrays
 - You can download each lecture video and source codes files

In this training course, we will learn about Python programming language and Numpy library with coding exercises in Jupyter Notebook in a very easy language.

Some of the Numpy commands we will use in this course:

  - Array
  - Array Attributes â€“ Shape, Reshape, Size, Dimension, Dtype
  - 1-D Array
  - 2-D Array
  - 3-D Array
  - Zeros Array
  - Ones Array
  - Full Array
  - Random Function
  - Linspace Function
  - Empty Function
  - Eye Function
  - Identity Function
  - Zeros like, Ones like, Full like Arrays
  - Diagonal Function
  - Transpose Function
  - Unary Operators
  - Vstack & Hstack
  - Array Indexing
  - Any & All Function

This course is suitable for beginners in the field of data science who are interested in Python.
