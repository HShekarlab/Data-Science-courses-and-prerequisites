This repository contains Natural Language Processing (NLP) Using NLTK in Python from the Udemy website. https://www.udemy.com/course/natural-language-processing-nlp-using-nltk-in-python/?couponCode=LETSLEARNNOWPP

We will learn in this tutorial:
- Attain a strong foundation in Python for deep learning and NLP.
- Build applications with Python, using the Natural Language Toolkit via NLP.
- Get to grips on various NLP techniques to build an intelligent Chatbot.
- Classify text and speech using the Naive Bayes Algorithm.
- Use various tools and algorithms to build real-world applications.
- Build solutions such as text similarity, summarization, sentiment analysis and anaphora resolution to get up to speed with new trends in NLP.
- Write your own POS taggers and grammars so that any syntactic analyses can be performed easily.
- Use the inbuilt chunker and create your own chunker to evaluate trained models.
- Create your own named entities using dictionaries to use inbuilt text classification algorithms.

* This course is useful for data science professionals who wish to expand their knowledge from traditional NLP techniques to advanced techniques in NLP application.
